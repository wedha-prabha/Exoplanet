# A World Away â€” Hunting for Exoplanets (demo)

This repository is a compact end-to-end demo of an exoplanet transit detection pipeline using synthetic light curves, a denoising autoencoder, and a hybrid CNN+Transformer model. It's designed to be runnable in one day to produce a working demo.

## Quickstart

1. Create virtual env and install:
